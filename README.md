# Reo ~ The Simple Dictionary

**Reo** is a dictionary application using the WordNet 3.1 (or 3.0) database for definitions and the reliable eSpeak for pronunciations (both audio and phoneme).

Light Mode                                 |  Dark Mode

![Welcome screen](images/ss.png?raw=true)  |  ![Welcome screen](images/ss1.png?raw=true)
![Searching](images/ss2.png?raw=true)  |  ![Searching](images/ss3.png?raw=true)

## Requirements

* DICT official client and server (dictd and dict) [Arch: `dictd`]
* WordNet 3.1 or 3.0 database for dictd (dict-wn) [Arch AUR: `dict-wn`]
* Python 3 [Arch: `python`]
* Python GObject [Arch: `python-gobject`] or PyQt5 [Arch: `python-pyqt5`]
* GTK 3.20+ [Arch: `gtk3`] or Qt 5.8+ [Arch: `qt5-base`]
* eSpeak-ng (For pronunciations and audio) [Arch: `espeak-ng`]

Run `reo` for the GTK GUI or `reo-qt` for the Qt GUI.

## Features

* Neat output with proper coloring and formatting
* Random Word
* Live Search
* Custom Definitions feature using Pango Markup or an HTML subset for formatting
* Lightweight. 1 mb only and further reducible (It does nothing on its own, so yeah)
* Support for GNOME Dark Mode and launching app in dark mode.

## Installation

To install, first make sure of the dependencies as listed above.

```bash
python setup.py install
```

For development (i.e. to see changes live as you make them):

```bash
python setup.py develop
```

## Troubleshooting

### Slow output

If the output is slow, it's possibly because the definition is obtained from dict.org rather than localhost. So, run

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now dictd.service
```

### Qt5 Interface

The Qt GUI is now pretty stable and seems to work well enough but the GTK GUI is still the recommended one, for now and probably forever. But Qt5 is fun to work with, so I'll be working on it anyway. Things to note:

* Right now, the Qt5 GUI is feature-complete. Everything that works in the GTK GUI also works in the Qt GUI. Except for a dark UI mode. That's up to the theme and color scheme on your configuration. However, the Qt GUI does have a "Dark Mode" that changes the font color scheme to one more suitable for usage with a dark color scheme.
* Most settings are shared between the two GUIs. Only GUI-specific settings are separated (dark mode for example).
* Another important thing to note is that the use of Qt5 won't make it cross-platform. It's still Linux-only and probably will remain so.

## Future

For me, this is more of an experiment than anything else. I try a lot of things, a lot of things work, a lot of things don't and I find it fun to play around with this. I also try code that I don't really understand in other projects (not risky stuff ofc), try to follow code standards and slowly try to get better at writing good code. I'm still bad at it though. Basically, a lot of this is experimentation and I don't plan to stop anytime soon, but somehow or the other, the project is generally stable and works for my daily use and I look up words a lot.

Basically it's just a GUI for some CLI tools. It doesn't even directly interact with dictd. And even the UI is badly done with Glade for GTK and Qt Designer for Qt5. So yeah, I'm lazy.
