### Using Nix

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dch82/Nixpkgs-Badges/main/nixpkgs-badge-light.svg)](https://search.nixos.org/packages?size=1&show=wordbook)

This method can be used anywhere the Nix package manager is installed.

### Using distro-specific packages

Right now, Wordbook is only packaged for Arch through the AUR as [`wordbook`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wordbook).

On NixOS, Wordbook can be installed using the Nix package manager as shown above. Additionally, the following code can be added to your NixOS configuration file, usually located in `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`.

```
  environment.systemPackages = [
    pkgs.wordbook
  ];
```

### From Source

To install, first make sure of the dependencies as listed above. You can use `just` to make the process easy.

```bash
just setup
just install
```

Without `just`:
```bash
mkdir -p _build
meson setup . _build
ninja -C _build install
```

For a local build with debugging enabled:

```bash
just run
# OR
just setup
just develop-configure
just local-run
```
